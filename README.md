# realtimeaudio
A library to abstract real time audio applications build on top of PyAudio.

# What does it do?
It extracts words spoken in real time and feeds it to a tf/keras model, and makes predictions. 
Can be used for applications like speech documentation, analysis, dataset preparation etc.

# Inspiration
Build originally for my project sharan21/Speech-Assisting-App, which is used to train a stutterer to improve fluency over a period of time.

# Future
Working on implementing a statistics generator, and a dashboard to analyse data.
